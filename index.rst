Welcome to Jaguar - PHP Graphic Library's documentation!
========================================================

Jaguar is a PHP5.3 OOP graphic library was built on the Greate `GD Library`_ using 
the best practices to build a stable and fast layer for image manipulation and 
drawing.

**Something to mention**

Jaguar was built on php gd extension and this extension is so famous with its
*"limitations"* in the php community (Which is wrong by the way) like memory and 
transparent problems for example.

Thats's what Jaguar is for , overcome those *"limitations"* and let the programmer
focus on the his/her application logic instead of spending hours trying to prserve
the transparent of an image and finally moves to photoshop to solve the problem.
